This model focuses on individual placements rather than systemic solutions, creates dependency on government funding cycles, limits strategic influence and cross-sector collaboration, and underutilises RWAV's unique neutral position and established relationships.",
    "futureVision": "The transformation positions RWAV as rural Victoria's trusted systems coordinator, using data intelligence and coalition leadership—leveraging the trust the community and stakeholders already have—to drive retention, workforce planning, and health system reform.

Current fragmentation costs rural health systems significantly more than coordination services would cost.\n\n### Ethical Framework\nAll revenue activities must enhance rather than compromise RWAV's primary mission, maintain organisational independence and credibility, provide genuine value to rural communities and healthcare professionals, support long-term sustainability without short-term exploitation, and align with RWAV's values of partnership, collaboration, and community focus.\n\n### Revenue Streams (Target 2030)\n\n| Stream | Target Percentage | Components |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Data Intelligence Services** | 10-12% revenue | Community Map subscriptions, workforce analytics, custom research |\n| **Coordination Administration** | 8-10% revenue | Multi-site supervision program administration, cross-regional partnership facilitation, coalition secretariat |\n| **Strategic Consultation** | 5-7% revenue | Rural health system design consultation, workforce planning, cultural safety expertise |\n| **Innovation Partnerships** | 2-3% revenue | Technology company partnerships, sponsored IMG pathways, corporate partnership facilitation |\n\n### Total Target\n**25-30% non-government revenue by 2030**\n\n### Implementation Approach\nPhased approach through pilot testing. Year 1 (2026): Revenue diversification pilot programs launch. Year 2 (2027): Data subscription services launch, 10% non-government revenue achievement. Year 3 (2028): Partnership revenue streams established, 15% non-government revenue achievement. Years 4-5 (2029-2030): Sustainable revenue model achieved (25-30%).\n\n### Ethical Safeguards\nMaintain clear separation between Commonwealth-funded activities and revenue-generating services. Ensure all revenue activities enhance rather than compromise RWAV's primary mission. Establish transparent pricing and service delivery standards. Regular review of revenue activities alignment with organisational values."

The four key revenue streams—Data Intelligence Services, Coordination Administration, Strategic Consultation, and Innovation Partnerships—are phased for implementation, with the Community Map platform serving as the foundational infrastructure for the largest revenue opportunity (Data Intelligence Services).
