  "EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY": {
    "currentState": "RWAV currently operates as a government-funded workforce placement service, competing with other agencies for limited recruitment success. This model focuses on individual placements rather than systemic solutions, creates dependency on government funding cycles, limits strategic influence and cross-sector collaboration, and underutilises RWAV's unique neutral position and established relationships.",
    "futureVision": "The transformation positions RWAV as rural Victoria's trusted systems coordinator, using data intelligence and coalition leadership\u2014leveraging the trust the community and stakeholders already have\u2014to drive retention, workforce planning, and health system reform. This addresses the coordination crisis while establishing sustainable revenue streams aligned with stakeholder needs.",
    "evidenceSummary": "The Community Pulse Survey reveals strong community support for coordination and partnership-based solutions, with 91% identifying poor coordination as a significant barrier and 74% expressing trust in Rural Workforce Agencies.",
